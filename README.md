# mit-map-animation
A map animation I created while studying at MITxPro's fullstack bootcamp. It shows bus stops near the MIT campus.


# How to run
1. Clone the repository
2. Open `index.html` in your browser

Make sure javascript is enabled, otherwise it won't work.


# Roadmap
I probably won't ever go back and edit this. Create an issue if you want a feature.
